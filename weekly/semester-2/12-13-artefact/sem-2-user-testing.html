                                As a result of several technical difficulties
                                with my artefacts, preparations for the open
                                studio were chaotic. Additionally, I had a very
                                sloppy table setup, lacking in details and
                                appearing cluttered.

                                Prior to the Open Studio, the lecturer had us
                                prepare a demo of how our tables would appear
                                during the Open Studio. It was noted that I did
                                not do a very good job of presenting my
                                artefacts, and some suggestions were given
                                regarding how to improve the presentation. For
                                the purpose of improving our displays, the
                                lecturer provided us with acrylic blocks and
                                wooden blocks. In comparison to plain paper, the
                                clear acrylic block gave a more polished
                                appearance to my prints.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In order to help my users understand the purpose
                                and how to interact with my artefacts, I have
                                added short descriptions to them. Following my
                                observations of my classmates' setups, I decided
                                to provide a summary of my research topic and
                                objective to enable users to understand why I
                                designed my artifacts in the way that I did.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Five days before Open Studio, my Bluetooth
                                speakers spoiled because of overcharging,
                                forcing me to rush to purchase a replacement.
                                The new speakers work well with my moss carpet,
                                however, they are much softer and bigger than my
                                previous speakers. Due to my need for a speaker
                                with an AUX port, I had limited options to
                                choose from. In order to resolve this issue, I
                                attempted to increase the volume level of the
                                audio clips in Adobe Audition to a level that
                                will prevent audio clipping. In the aftermath of
                                the Open Studio, I will have to devote a greater
                                amount of time to designing the audio tracks.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                From my preparations for Open Studio, I have
                                learned the importance of starting early! Having
                                attended the demo table setup session five days
                                before Open Studio, I am extremely grateful. If
                                my speakers failed on Monday, I would have been
                                in full panic mode, since Open Studio commences
                                on Tuesday, which means I would only have a day
                                to fix any technical issues.

                            <p class="p__size-l">
                                I presented my design outcomes during the Open
                                Studio Session and received valuable feedback
                                from my classmates and visitors. In general, the
                                moss carpet artefact was well received, but I
                                received feedback that I could enhance the user
                                experience by including a short video that shows
                                where I collected the field recordings to better
                                engage the audience. Furthermore, I received
                                feedback regarding my set-up display. Since my
                                speakers are rather large in size, I felt that
                                placing the right and left speakers together
                                made the table appear crowded. In order to
                                resolve this problem, someone suggested that I
                                place the right and left speakers on separate
                                platforms. I have been advised by most people
                                that I should improve my audio transition
                                because it stops very abruptly once you touch
                                another sensor.

                                Many people commented on my textile noise maker
                                that they liked the concept of manually rubbing
                                to produce textile noise, and they said the
                                sensation reminds them of ASMR, autonomous
                                sensory meridian response; a sensation of
                                tingling, static, or goosebumps in response to
                                specific audio or visual stimuli. The
                                visualisation for the textile noise maker in
                                TouchDesigner will also require some time as
                                more time was spent on the moss carpet.

                                The class today consisted of setting up our
                                prototypes and giving each other feedback
                                regarding how we feel about our classmates
                                works.

                                The lecturer thought that the TouchDesigner idea
                                was interesting and quite a few people did not
                                understand the concept behind the textile noise
                                maker because it deviated greatly from the
                                research topic of urban noise pollution because
                                the play kit set and image distortion idea made
                                use of field recordings. To connect the textile
                                noise maker with my other artefacts, I must find
                                another method.

                                During today's prototype consultation, I showed
                                my paper prototype of the play kit set to the
                                lecturer. We agreed that the original idea would
                                be too difficult to conceal the cables and
                                electronic components. It was originally
                                intended that the play kit set would be an
                                educational kit in which kids would become more
                                aware of the effects of urban noise pollution.
                                However, the method of using 3D-printed birds
                                and trees did not work well because the children
                                would not understand why natural bird sounds are
                                substituted with urban sounds instead.

                                I decided to implement my other idea of creating
                                a fabric moss carpet to act as a sound sensor
                                for the touch board. This will enable the
                                electronic components to be hidden better. The
                                lecturer gave me several suggestions on how I
                                could include conductive materials in the
                                carpet.

                                For my textile noise maker, I signed up for a
                                studio session since I needed assistance setting
                                up an Arduino Piezo buzzer. The lecturer
                                provided me with instructions on how to proceed
                                and which electronic components I would need to
                                purchase. As a result of the lecturer's code,
                                the vibrations induced by the various textures
                                were displayed using an Arduino serial plotter
                                graph.<br>

                                buzzer given that when you rub the scraper
                                against the textures, the graph is not very
                                responsive and slow.

                                today by the lecturer. Having never soldered
                                wires before, I attended the session. During the
                                soldering session, my friends practised
                                soldering the wires on my moss carpet. I greatly
                                appreciated their assistance since I was not
                                familiar with soldering all the wires myself and
                                maintaining a steady hand was challenging for
                                me. As a result of the cables being attached to
                                the touch board, the carpet was more durable and
                                the cables would not disconnect during
                                transportation.
                            </p>

                                The other challenging aspect of the soldering
                                session was that I had difficulty removing the
                                rubber coating from the cable because I kept
                                cutting it off instead of just the rubber
                                coating. One of my classmates suggested that I
                                use a wire stripper since it only removes the
                                rubber coating, not the copper wires. In
                                addition, the lecturer recommended that I use
                                hot glue to protect the exposed copper wires
                                from breakage.

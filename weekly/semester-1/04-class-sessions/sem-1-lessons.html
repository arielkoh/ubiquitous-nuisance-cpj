                                    The lecturer discussed the deliverables of
                                    our final year project during today's
                                    session. Throughout the course, the lecturer
                                    repeated the term framework and failure. He
                                    invited Matthew, an alumni of our course, to
                                    share his final-year project thinking
                                    process. As he shared his tips, I found them
                                    to be useful. During his presentation, he
                                    explained how he divided the design process
                                    into smaller parts and examined different
                                    frameworks in order to determine which
                                    framework was suitable for his project.

                                    As part of the last activity, we were
                                    required to create a mind map describing our
                                    research topic. As a result of what the
                                    lecturer said about taking the uncomplicated
                                    way out, I actually considered combining
                                    sound and touch, but decided not to do so.
                                    In addition to sound, during the prototyping
                                    stage, I could explore how other senses
                                    might be able to assist in the support of
                                    sound interaction.

                                    In today's lesson, the lecturer introduced
                                    us to experimental methods. The task for
                                    today was to conduct a simple experiment
                                    that related to your research topic. I found
                                    myself having difficulty choosing what to do
                                    after watching my classmates conduct their
                                    experiments.

                                    Some of my classmates were playing with
                                    Arduino, an open-source electronics
                                    platform. While I heard Aditi explain how to
                                    proceed with this platform, it was very
                                    confusing to me since all the wires and
                                    strange electronic parts made me feel as if
                                    I were in a science or robotics lesson.

                                    I conducted a simple experiment involving
                                    cutting out foam and cardboard
                                    into a variety of shapes and sizes in order
                                    to test how different shapes and sizes
                                    affected sound. The experiment was not
                                    completed because I was unable to use a
                                    speaker during the lesson, so I was
                                    required to perform the experiment
                                    at home.

                                    We are in our first prototyping session
                                    today. The lecturer demonstrated how we can
                                    use various materials to create our
                                    prototypes. The example of the "Shy Robot"
                                    was very interesting and cute because it
                                    looked like a shy child or animal. There are
                                    sensors built into the arms so that they
                                    will avoid your hands if you attempt to
                                    touch them.

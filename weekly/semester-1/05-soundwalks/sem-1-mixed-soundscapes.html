                                    As part of my primary and secondary research
                                    for my year two research compendium, I
                                    recorded some sound recordings at Pasir Ris
                                    Coastal Park.

                                    Sea waves recorded in windy conditions sound
                                    strong and rapid. As you approach the rocky
                                    side of the beach, the waves will crash into
                                    the rocks nearby, amplifying the sound.

                                    One unique feature of Pasir Ris Coastal Park
                                    is the Mangrove Boardwalk, which allows
                                    visitors to get close to creatures and
                                    plants in the mangrove forest. The
                                    soundscape changes depending on the timing,
                                    since more creatures will appear later in
                                    the day. The birds I recorded during my walk
                                    in Pasir Ris Coastal Park in the morning are
                                    accompanied by two samples of bird sounds.

                                    As a result of the pandemic, I missed
                                    hearing the children's laughter at the BBQ
                                    pits and playgrounds. The park was crowded
                                    with families which was pleasant to witness.

                                    Reflection — Problems with volume output<br>
                                    Since this was my first time using my sound
                                    recorder, I was unsure of how to set it up.
                                    The microphone level on my recorder was set
                                    too low, which prevented me from hearing my
                                    recordings once they were transferred to my
                                    laptop. Although I was able to hear some
                                    recordings when I increased the volume
                                    levels in Adobe Audition, many clipping
                                    sounds were evident since I had to use the
                                    maximum volume. Due to windy conditions and
                                    the amount of editing required in Adobe
                                    Audition, my bird's field recordings
                                    sounded robotic and lifeless.

                                    Considering that I was still unfamiliar with
                                    using my sound recorder, I felt it was safer
                                    to record in areas close to my home in case
                                    I encountered technical difficulties. I
                                    recorded at Pasir Ris Hawker Center due to
                                    its proximity to where I live. Pasir Ris did
                                    not have a <a
                                        href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/long-awaited-hipster-pasir-ris-central-hawker-centre-opens">
                                        hawker centre</a> for a long time
                                    until 25 January 2018. It featured a dual
                                    concept of traditional food and modern
                                    hipster cuisine served in the same venue.
                                    There are two levels at the hawker centre
                                    where traditional food is served at the
                                    first level and interesting stalls selling
                                    fusion food is served on the second level.
                                    It was designed to support our hawker
                                    culture in Singapore by encouraging younger
                                    hawker sellers to continue our tradition.

                                    Although my recordings were better than my
                                    first attempt, I still feel the sound
                                    quality could have been improved. In my
                                    field recordings, I have used my onboard
                                    microphones, but I believe I will be able to
                                    improve the quality of the recordings by
                                    using a secondary microphone that will
                                    remain stationary since the sound recorder
                                    is very sensitive to movement, so walking
                                    while recording is difficult. It is possible
                                    to hear sounds of bicycles, people talking,
                                    and parents eating at the hawker centre with
                                    their children. My audio quality was better
                                    because I placed my sound recorder on the
                                    table rather than walking around while I was
                                    recording.

                                    sound sources, the audio output is noisy.

                                    attempt to clean up the audio as there were
                                    several layers of sounds present. A
                                    soundscape such as this contrasts with the
                                    recordings collected from Pasir Ris Park.

                                    It was a pleasure to catch a performance for
                                    the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival on 10
                                    September. I liked a few performances from
                                    various secondary and primary schools,
                                    my favourite performance was the Chinese
                                    orchestra from Pasir Ris Secondary School.
                                    They performed traditional Chinese songs,
                                    pop songs, and the soundtrack from
                                    Netflix Korean drama 'Squid Game'.

                                    While trying to focus on the performance,
                                    you may hear the audio of someone talking
                                    with the microphone, and background music
                                    playing in all directions when a number of
                                    events are taking place at Tampines Hub at

                                    distracted by the nearby food stalls and the
                                    fact that different people usually rent the

                                    different events, so you have a wide variety

                                <p
                                    class="p__size-l">
                                    As my first field recording attempt was not
                                    satisfactory, I decided to return to Pasir
                                    Ris Coastal Park and record the audio again.
                                    I recorded birds, bicycles, people walking
                                    and talking, as well as music being played.
                                    Roosters were a common sight in Pasir Ris
                                    Park. As a result of the park's proximity to
                                    the road, some recordings contained sounds
                                    from vehicles. Whenever I was near the park,
                                    the roosters would crow at odd times,
                                    such as the evening timing. The audio of
                                    someone coughing after her workout
                                    overlapped with the bird sounds in one
                                    recording, so I did not crop or remove it.
                                    This was a difficult recording to make
                                    amendments.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In order to record audio, I visited the
                                    mangrove forest at Pasir Ris Coastal Park.
                                    There was a large number of people in the
                                    park today. A number of people were using
                                    their telephoto lenses to capture images of
                                    birds. The weekend is typically a time when
                                    I see many groups of photographers or solo
                                    photographers. My only observations were of
                                    common bird species and mudskippers. The
                                    rest of the animals were concealed. In
                                    addition, I had recorded field recordings of
                                    the ocean waves and families having fun on
                                    the beach.

                                    Reflection — Playing music out loud at the
                                    park<br>
                                    As a park should be a place of relaxation,
                                    it did not please me to hear people playing
                                    music at a high volume through their
                                    speakers. Sometimes I prefer an environment
                                    where there are fewer man-made noises
                                    Although there are natural sounds to be
                                    heard, they are often overshadowed by loud
                                    music and construction noises. While I do
                                    not object to people listening to music
                                    during workouts at a lower volume, it would
                                    be more considerate if they used headphones
                                    or earphones to avoid disturbing others or
                                    wildlife. A mangrove forest, for instance,
                                    is not the appropriate location to play loud
                                    music because it could become overly loud
                                    since the space is much smaller than the
                                    beach areas of the parks, which are more
                                    open, and the music will need to travel
                                    farther.

                                    Due to the fact that all my field recordings
                                    have been located on the east side of
                                    Singapore, I went to a new location to
                                    conduct my soundwalk. Since Nex Shopping
                                    Centre is located in Serangoon, a central
                                    part of Singapore, there is a great deal of
                                    traffic, even on weekdays. I went to the
                                    arcade for the recording. I haven't been
                                    there in a long time, so I forgot how noisy
                                    it was. There were many people playing
                                    different games in the arcade. There were a
                                    few games that looked interesting, but the
                                    one that stood out was <a

                                        Taiko no Tatsujin</a>, a popular
                                    Japanese game. The main objective of the
                                    game is to hit a simulated Taiko drum in
                                    response to notes scrolling from the right
                                    as you play. The game is available on a
                                    number of platforms, but the arcade version
                                    is the most popular, as players can interact
                                    with the actual drums, which is more
                                    engaging than playing it on a screen.

                                    The last place I went was 'Pet Lovers
                                    Centre'. This branch is unique due to the
                                    gigantic size of the space. There are two
                                    levels to the branch. Level one is
                                    designated for smaller animals such as
                                    hamsters, rabbits and marine animals, while
                                    level two is designated for dogs and pet
                                    grooming services. The other branches in
                                    Singapore are tiny and sell only pet items
                                    and small animals such as rabbits and
                                    hamsters.

                                    Reflection — Noise caused by human actions<br>
                                    Usually, the dogs are quiet in the shop, but
                                    there is a family in the shop that keeps
                                    irritating them with their pet dog. There
                                    was a great deal of noise, but
                                    unfortunately, the staff in charge was not
                                    in the area. I also found that the pet shop
                                    location could be better. If I could move
                                    it, I would probably not locate it near the
                                    arcade because the noise will affect the
                                    animals there.

                                    Since you do not require a quiet location
                                    for shopping unless you are trying to relax
                                    in a cafe to read a book, I found it
                                    difficult to locate sources of urban noise
                                    at shopping malls. As an example of how
                                    urban noise can be solved, the library at
                                    the shopping mall is located on a level that
                                    is isolated from the noisy shops. Generally,
                                    most shopping malls in Singapore place the
                                    library and tuition centres on one level to
                                    reduce noise levels.

                            <h2>Chinatown</h2>
                            <p class="p__size-l">
                                There are many places in Chinatown where I
                                collected field recordings, including a street
                                market, a wet market, and a gathering place
                                where people played traditional board games. The
                                music I recorded near the entrance to the
                                Chinatown Metro station is an interesting
                                overlap between people talking and selling their
                                goods. The market will not feel like Chinatown
                                without familiar music. It is a pleasure for me
                                to visit the 'Chinatown Street Market' because
                                the place has interesting stalls and people
                                performing different activities in the same
                                place at the same time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The recordings I have made also include birds
                                since a shop sells parrots. Music can be
                                heard from the television in shops and
                                restaurants. I recorded some audio from pigeons
                                sitting on a telephone line near one of the
                                nearby shops. Due to the radio playing in the
                                shop, the sound was not clear. There was an
                                artist attempting a watercolour painting of
                                the street market. It was quite interesting to
                                observe how the artist selected a secluded spot
                                that was not as noisy and crowded as the stalls
                                in the middle of the market.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The market has a gathering place where tables
                                and chairs are established for traditional
                                games. When there are so many spectators and a
                                noisy soundscape because it is near the street,
                                wet market and temple, I always wondered how
                                players can concentrate on playing a complex
                                game such as 'Xiangqi' also known as Chinese
                                Chess. The second place I visited was the wet
                                market, which was quite empty since I was not
                                there during the peak hours. Wet markets are
                                usually full in the morning. It is possible to
                                hear some audio of people conversing in the
                                recordings since the wet market is located
                                directly in front of the car park. You can also
                                hear the sounds of vehicles in the recordings
                                since the car park is located directly in front
                                of the wet market.

                                Perhaps we can create a more pleasant soundscape
                                if the area where the players gather is not so
                                open, as I would not be able to concentrate in
                                such a noisy environment when playing such a
                                complex game like chess.

                                In order to create more contrast between the
                                soundscapes, I visited Singapore Botanical
                                Gardens. I also felt that I should visit
                                locations that are further apart from where I
                                live. I recorded people performing their
                                activities at the location and birds in the same
                                space. Several families enjoyed their time at
                                the location, and photographers were attempting
                                to capture the birds that were hiding in the
                                trees. The recording also contains the sounds of
                                children having fun in an open, safe
                                environment. In the background, there is a
                                sudden audio recording of a moving vehicle that
                                disrupts the pleasant audio recording of the
                                children. As a result, the staff at the facility
                                are able to travel more conveniently around the
                                large space through the use of a vehicle,
                                helping to ease the workload. The above example
                                illustrates that urban noises cannot be avoided
                                even when you wish to relax and be unhindered.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In the recording, there is a faint sound of an
                                animal, but I cannot identify them, so I am
                                unsure of what I am recording. Water sounds from
                                the pond and footsteps were recorded. Many
                                families brought their dogs to run in the open
                                green spaces. This was difficult to accomplish
                                in the apartment buildings. I recorded a few
                                audio files describing dog owners conversing
                                with one another as well as children trying to
                                get closer to dogs. Due to my proximity to the
                                cafe, you can hear the audio of cafe's music
                                playing in the background masking the natural
                                soundscape.

                                My perception of the soundscape of this location
                                is that it sounded okay up to the point where
                                you are near the main road. At these places, you
                                can hear loud vehicles moving, as well as some
                                machine sounds. I also found the cafe's music
                                volume to be too loud because I could hear it
                                when I was near the cafe as well as the
                                transportation used by the staff and the
                                staff-only workshop area that is hidden away
                                from visitors.

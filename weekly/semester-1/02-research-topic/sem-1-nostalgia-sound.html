                                My objective was to investigate how sound can
                                evoke emotions, since past methods relied
                                heavily on the sense of sight, visual cues, and
                                personal items such as mementoes for the purpose
                                of evoking emotions. Portable acoustic devices
                                such as smartphones can be used as tools for
                                self-reflection in order to create a controlled
                                soundscape that is customized to you.

                                Soundwalk is an important tool for soundscape
                                awareness. The action of the soundwalk is an
                                exploration of sound with the intention of
                                active listening. Researchers have suggested
                                that the act of a soundwalk can be a personal
                                biography. As you move through the environment,
                                you are invoking emotions and recalling memories
                                of the location and sound.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I am fascinated by how the experience of sound
                                combined with the act of soundwalk affects our
                                perceptions of time, place, and thoughts through
                                the practice of soundwalks. As a means of
                                understanding and engaging with the soundscape
                                found in the environment, the process of
                                soundwalk activates the production of memory as
                                well as the act of remembering.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In order to prepare for my soundwalks, I created
                                a mind map of locations. Initially, I selected
                                locations based on the level of familiarity I
                                had with them, but after the feedback session
                                with the lecturer, I realised my locations were
                                too random, making it difficult to analyse the
                                field recordings collected. To group the
                                locations in the mind map, the amount of human
                                traffic flow is taken into account.

                                The topic of sound and memory seemed too complex
                                to me because it involves too many interests,
                                and I was not confident of my ability to make
                                the connection between sound and memory in a
                                design context.

                                My interest in the subject of sound and memory
                                was sparked by seeing projects online in which
                                designers created typographic patterns. I
                                thought it was an interesting approach since
                                patterns can also stimulate branding ideas.

                                Following the feedback session, the lecturer
                                considered the topic too specific, as I will be
                                unable to do much exploration or experimentation
                                on this project since I have already envisaged
                                its outcome.

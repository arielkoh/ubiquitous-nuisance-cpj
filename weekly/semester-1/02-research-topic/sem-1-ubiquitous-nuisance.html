                                The use of soundwalks to understand our
                                soundscapes is examined in this study. According
                                to R. Murray Schafer, author of 'The Soundscape:
                                Our Environment and the Tuning of the World',
                                the Industrial Revolution adversely affected our
                                sonic environment. With the increased artificial
                                sounds created by machines, our sonic
                                environment has become overcrowded, reducing our
                                ability to hear clearly (Franinovi et al. 7-8).

                                With the soundwalk practice, you can explore the
                                environment as you explore it with the intention
                                of active listening. As you move through the
                                space, you will understand and remember the
                                sounds that you may have missed about the sonic
                                environment (Schine).

                                Objectives or purposes of research<br>
                                My research aims to identify the specific
                                experiences we experience when we interact with
                                sound, and to examine how these experiences
                                differ from the experiences we have with other
                                sensory inputs like sight, touch, and smell and
                                how artists, designers, and researchers design,
                                structure, and compose these interactions.
                                Moreover, I am interested in investigating
                                whether the growing use of portable acoustic
                                devices, including smartphones and media
                                players, can be used as a means of creating our
                                own personal soundscapes we may be able to
                                control, as urban noises from the outside have
                                no control over us? How do we respond to nature,
                                culture, physiology, and psychology?

                                What I expect to discover from this research<br>
                                What are the conditions in which urban noise is
                                not simply a nuisance, but a clue to
                                understanding what conditions our sonic
                                environment is in, how we can limit the harmful
                                effects of urban noise, what might our future
                                sound like if we gave urban noise issues the
                                appropriate attention needed, and why some
                                sounds are pleasing while others annoy us.

                                topic<br>
                                Having created a mind map of topics that I wish
                                to study or experiment on, I felt that it would
                                be more effective and interesting if I created a
                                physical artefact for my project.

                                Reflection — Changing my research topic<br>
                                After evaluating my previous research topic, I
                                felt that focusing on urban noises provided me
                                with more clarity. It was difficult for me to
                                relate memory to sound as it was too abstract
                                for me and I felt that the research was too
                                complicated and it might take me more than a
                                year to complete. I struggled with this concept.

                                In regards to my research topic, I received some
                                feedback from my classmates who thought my
                                research aim was unclear when I explained it.
                                Aditi told me that she tried mixing white noise
                                with pink noise but did not succeed. As a
                                result, I believed this might be an excellent
                                opportunity to investigate the disconnection of
                                noises as a method for creating an artefact that
                                will bring awareness to sound pollution through
                                irritating noises. As part of my research
                                project, my lecturer recommended that I visit
                                the Nafa exhibition 'Peel Here'.

                                the lecturer again. The feedback was that
                                because my field recordings were collected from
                                so many locations; the recordings were difficult
                                to analyse and felt quite random since the
                                recordings were collected from so many
                                locations. I and the lecturer determined that it
                                would be more effective to concentrate on parks
                                that are close to residential areas and those

                                caused by various modes of transportation,
                                construction sites, and heavy human traffic.

                                Due to our heavy dependence on machines, we
                                have fewer opportunities to hear the natural
                                soundscape as a result of our rapidly growing
                                society.

                                As a consequence, we have created a
                                soundscape with overcrowded sound signals that
                                makes it difficult for us to focus and relax
                                because of the urban noise pollution.

                                overcrowded sound signals, making it

                            To understand the social aspects and impacts of
                            urban noise, I will use acoustic ecology and
                            soundwalks. The primary objective of this project is
                            to assist people in understanding how they can
                            reduce the negative effects of urban noise on the
                            local soundscapes in their neighbourhoods. A
                            soundwalk is being conducted in Singapore parks in
                            order to learn more about the urban noises that can
                            be found there. In order to understand the
                            differences between parks located near residential
                            areas and those located more secluded, I intend to
                            compare them. As a designer, I intend to use my
                            collected recordings to create a design artefact
                            that raises awareness of urban noise pollution and
                            inspires people to imagine what a better future
                            might sound like if urban noise issues were given
                            the attention they deserve.

                            research using soundwalks to observe urban noises

                            the commercial market because the main focus
                            is set for users to think about personal or

                                pm and 6 pm. It is my intention to visit each
                                chosen park twice, once during the week and once
                                at the weekend, in order to compare the amount

                                noise. I will keep a journal of what sounds were

                                It was interesting that the artist used candy
                                head dispensers to represent birds. He created a
                                symphony of bird sounds with the artefacts, and
                                the buttons were produced by electric paint
                                sensors. For my design artefact, I was
                                considering the possibility of playing man-made
                                urban sounds instead. I thought that would be an
                                interesting concept.

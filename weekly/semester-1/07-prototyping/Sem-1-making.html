                                The prototype was constructed by cutting strips
                                of aluminium foil tape and connecting them to
                                the touch board using alligator clips. The
                                electronic components were then concealed in a
                                foam box.

                                Five foam boards were cut out for the top,
                                right, left, front, and back of the device. The
                                base is going to be left empty so I can easily
                                swap the elections or switch on the elections. I
                                decided to cut out eight holes for the sensors
                                because making 12 sensors would be too crowded.
                                The cutout aluminium foil tapes will be
                                connected with alligator cables. The sensors
                                were adhered to using clear tape.

                                If I were to use my laptop as a power source, I
                                would have two holes on the sides of the
                                enclosure to connect the speaker cable and power
                                cable. As the speaker I used this time was too
                                large, I might consider switching to my smaller
                                size speaker, although the larger speaker is
                                more attractive than just exposing the
                                electronic components. The end result appeared
                                to be much neater than just exposing the
                                electronic components.

                            <p class="p__size-l">
                                For my education kit idea for children, I tried
                                modelling a low poly tree using Blender. Since I
                                last touched any 3D modelling software eight
                                years ago, I was not able to recall much and
                                needed to review some online videos in order to
                                refresh my memory. The first model that I did
                                had a topology problem because you can see in
                                the wireframe that some faces and vertex points
                                are colliding.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It was my intention to export my tree as a paper
                                model in Blender, but the shape was too complex.
                                Instead of doing separate parts, I created a
                                model from a single object. I was able to export
                                the paper temple after redoing the model, but I
                                noticed the template may not be suitable for
                                children because it seemed too complex for them
                                to fold. Additionally, I noticed my model had
                                some errors. For example, the base of the tree
                                is too small to provide adequate stability to
                                the model.
                            </p>

                            <p class="p__size-s p__width-s">
                                The paper model did not work when I was cutting
                                it because the template had some mistakes where
                                some of the important folding parts were missing
                                or overlapping. The weight of the paper I tested
                                it on was too thin that I made some mistakes
                                while doing the cutting and my model were not
                                strong enough to stand because of the paper and
                                skinny base.

                                While trying to generate visuals from my sound
                                recordings using p5.js, I was able to find many
                                references related to sound-generated visuals,
                                however I was unable to find much information
                                about image distortion. The references I found
                                on image distortion are just generated effects,
                                but I am still unclear about how I can link
                                these effects to my audio files through code. My
                                plan is to explore more and experiment with
                                TouchDesigner to determine if it is a more
                                suitable platform for me.

                                Initially, I referenced a p5.js sketch I found
                                online that uses oscillators to generate a tone.<br>
                                <a

                                In an attempt to edit the code, I added my audio
                                file so the number of oscillators could alter
                                the sound of my audio file through the
                                'mousePressed' action. This approach appears
                                interesting because I could explore the code
                                further to produce a synthesiser.

                                In this code, I attempted to generate a circular
                                stroke that will react to the audio file that I
                                upload into my sketch. Unfortunately, I was
                                unable to make the pixel effect follow the audio
                                file, so the effect appears to be random.

                                As an alternative design, I created a circular
                                pattern based on angular lines that almost
                                resembles a spider web.

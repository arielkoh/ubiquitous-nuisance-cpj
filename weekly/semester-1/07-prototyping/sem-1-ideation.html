                                    After sketching out a variety of ideas for
                                    my artefact, I have no clue how to proceed
                                    with the actual making process, as it seems
                                    too complex to me.

                                    Cymatics is the study of visible sound and
                                    vibration, which is a subset of modal
                                    phenomena. As a result of sound vibration,
                                    waves form and spread everywhere.
                                </p>

                                    My idea was to make use of a mini projector
                                    that would be placed underneath a tray of
                                    water and in between my speaker location
                                    would be a mini projector. I sketched a
                                    rough sketch of how my artefact would work.
                                    The concept is that the projector will
                                    project an image of the park where I have
                                    collected the sound recordings, and based on
                                    the vibrations of the speakers, a water tray
                                    will distort the image projector if the
                                    volume is increased as the speaker will be
                                    forced to shake more.
                                </p>

                                    I was inspired by a <a
                                        href="https://www.designboom.com/project/visualize-sound/">project</a>
                                    by Japanese artist Akira Okamoto which
                                    visualises sound by shining a bright light
                                    through the water to show patterns resulting
                                    from the vibrations created by the speakers.
                                    My idea was to use a mini projector that
                                    will be placed beneath a tray of water and
                                    my speakers will be located in between the
                                    tray and the projector. I thought this would
                                    be a very interesting approach. I created a
                                    rough sketch of how the artefact will
                                    look and operate.

                                    As a second idea, I wanted to combine white
                                    and pink noises in order to create a loud
                                    soundscape. Generally, white and pink noises
                                    are designed to distract you from unwanted
                                    noise in your environment, however when
                                    combined, they may become distracting due to
                                    their varying frequencies.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Although I could not locate much information
                                    regarding the mixing of white and pink
                                    noises, a classmate of mine stated that
                                    mixing both forms of noise was difficult. My
                                    opinion was that it would be beneficial for
                                    them to not mix, as this might help me
                                    better illustrate my noise pollution issue.
                                    We often go to places of relaxation such as
                                    public parks to hear the sounds of nature,
                                    but they are often also polluted by man-made
                                    noises from construction sites, traffic and
                                    residential areas. As such, my artefact can
                                    be an effective artefact for my purpose if
                                    it is capable of polluting white and pink
                                    noise by means of a sound synthesiser.
                                </p>

                                    The white and pink noise will both be
                                    controlled by the turning knob to select the
                                    amount of white and pink noise you want to
                                    incorporate into your soundscape. The other
                                    knobs will be for volume control and if
                                    possible the different types of white and
                                    pink noise you can choose from. I have the
                                    most complex idea out of all the sketches I
                                    have made.

                                    Initially, I considered the noise maker
                                    design to be too generic and boring. I
                                    considered the possibility of using textures
                                    to create sound as an alternative to the
                                    original design. As an example, I get
                                    goosebumps when I hear the sound of chalk
                                    rubbing against a chalkboard, metal cutlery
                                    scraping, or styrofoam rubbing against one
                                    another. Because I attended a robot arm
                                    workshop and learned that excessive pressure
                                    will cause the software to crash, I am
                                    uncertain if I will be able to implement
                                    this idea. I'm thinking about a more manual
                                    approach instead since the arm seemed too
                                    fragile.

                                    manual. My lecturer thought that the manual
                                    approach is simple yet effective since the
                                    robot arm idea seemed too complex and
                                    ineffective.

                            <p class="p__size-l">
                                The Newton's cradle was designed by French
                                scientist Edme Mariotte in honour of Sir Isaac
                                Newton. Through the use of swinging spheres,
                                this device illustrates the conservation of
                                momentum and energy. The spheres are lifted and
                                released, transferring force from the stationary
                                spheres to the last sphere, lifting the last
                                sphere into the air. A reverse effect is created
                                when the spheres bounce against each other and
                                strike each other. My inspiration came from <a

                                by Xavier Sole Mora. With the help of a parrot
                                candy head dispenser, the artist has created an
                                artefact in which the candy dispenser heads move
                                up and down as the bird sounds are played. In
                                place of bird sounds, I thought it would be
                                interesting to listen to man-made noises
                                produced by a natural soundscape or by an
                                animal.

                            <p class="p__size-s p__width-s">
                                While sketching my artefact, I intended the
                                metal balls to have a birdlike appearance. As
                                the balls are made of conductive material, I
                                will be installing cables to the touch board in
                                order to generate sounds. Upon contact between
                                the balls, the sound being played will change.
                                According to the lecturer, this idea lacked
                                control and was too random, therefore I should
                                concentrate on my other ideas.

                                Using the same thinking approach as my Newton's
                                Cradle concept, this idea combines man-made
                                sounds with natural sounds. My objective was to
                                create a 3D representation of a natural
                                soundscape, like a public park in Singapore. I
                                am considering whether a realistic design
                                approach or an abstract design approach will be
                                more appealing to the audience. In order to
                                serve as sensors for the touch board, the pieces
                                will be constructed of conductive materials. In
                                addition, I think it would be cool if the birds
                                could move once a sound is played, but I am
                                unsure how to connect both microcontroller
                                boards from different brands.

                                I am still considering if this idea is good
                                because I feel like there is a danger of the
                                whole artefact looking too childish for my
                                research topic unless my target audience is
                                children, in which case I can consider creating
                                an education kit or workshop aimed at educating
                                kids about noise pollution in an engaging and
                                fun manner.

                                In my kit, I thought it would be interesting to
                                make low poly 3D models of birds and trees in
                                Blender for 3D printing, but I was unsure
                                whether it would be possible to 3D print with
                                conductive material. The entire packing will be
                                used to create the background of a park so that
                                it appears to be a natural soundscape, and once
                                a child touches any of the conductive models, a
                                man-made sound will be played from the speakers
                                to demonstrate how the natural sounds of a park
                                are masking by urban noise. To my knowledge, it
                                is possible to activate two sensors at the same
                                time with the help of coding, but I do not know
                                whether that approach will work if the touch
                                board in the kit is not connected to coding
                                software such as p5.js. Currently, I am able to
                                play one sensor at a time; however, I have not
                                been able to figure how to code the touch board
                                for using more than one sensor simultaneously.

                                In my initial thought, I thought it would be
                                interesting to combine the noise maker and
                                cymatics to form my designed artefact, but when
                                I researched the cymatics technique further, I
                                encountered several issues. According to my
                                research, cymatics does not work well with music
                                or songs; instead, they create interesting
                                patterns using a tone generator and frequencies.
                                Therefore, I am unsure whether I want to pursue
                                this idea further as I would like to take
                                advantage of the field recordings I have
                                collected from my soundwalks to a greater
                                extent. Additionally, I noticed that the speaker
                                must be positioned in the centre of the chladni
                                plate, so if I were to project the patterns on
                                the ceiling, this would obstruct the projector
                                on the bottom.

                                This approach was considered too high risk by
                                the lecturer, and he advised that I code the
                                image distortion using P5.js or TouchDesigner,
                                since there is a lower risk of failure and it
                                may even demonstrate the effects of urban sound
                                pollution clearly. As a result of the lecturer's
                                suggestion, I was encouraged to produce several
                                small artefacts as showcases so that I could
                                concentrate on smaller goals rather than making
                                a very complex and large project that might not
                                work out as well as I had thought. In order to
                                ensure that the information I collected from my
                                soundwalks was accurate, I thought that it would
                                be interesting to have artefacts on the
                                experimental side and one artefact on the
                                educational or commercial side.

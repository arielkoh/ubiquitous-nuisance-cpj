                                My research topic was changed to urban noise
                                pollution because the previous topic made it
                                difficult for me to choose my research question.
                                Despite the topic change, some of my previous
                                readers could still be used, as there are books
                                that discuss our interactions with sound, but
                                nothing too specific. This new research topic
                                remains relevant to the readers

                                By moving, we contribute to the soundscape
                                of a place. The act of moving allows us to
                                connect the experience of space with the
                                experience of sound. In urban settings,
                                noise maps are an effective strategy for
                                describing sound. The European Union
                                launched its Environmental Noise Directive
                                in 2002 which has been widely adopted
                                throughout Europe (Hallgren 54).

                                            This online article</a> written by
                                        Jennifer Schine examines how the
                                        practice of soundwalks can be a tool for
                                        memory retrieval. This practice involves
                                        active listening to environmental sounds
                                        while moving through the environment. In
                                        addition to providing information about
                                        the self, soundwalks provide information
                                        about social consciousness and
                                        collective memory of place, as well as
                                        self and social consciousness.

                                        As a result of reading the article, I
                                        was able to gain a deeper understanding
                                        of the soundwalk practice. I believe it
                                        is a valuable tool in bringing awareness
                                        to noises within our surroundings, which
                                        might have been overlooked due to the
                                        busy lifestyle we lead in Singapore.

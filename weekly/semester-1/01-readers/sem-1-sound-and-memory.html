                                It was my intention to combine all of our senses
                                as part of my final project. However, there was
                                no clear path, and I became confused.

                                As a result of reading several readers, I
                                decided to focus my research on the perception
                                of sound, although I may try to incorporate
                                other senses during prototyping in order to
                                enhance sound interaction. These readers helped
                                me to gain a general understanding of sound
                                interaction design. I found the keyword
                                'Soundscape' in the reader, 'Sonic Interaction
                                Design'. The concept of the soundscape intrigued
                                me, so I searched for more readers on the
                                subject. I was inspired to pursue my research on
                                soundscape by R. Murray Schafer,
                                <a

                                    who popularised the concept of the
                                    soundscape</a>. From researching soundscape,
                                I became interested in soundwalks, and
                                determined that this would be my primary
                                research focus for my final year project.

                                and their experiences with them.

                                    The Soundscape</a> in 1993,
                                a concept coined by him—that describes the sonic
                                environment in which we are all immersed, the
                                ever-present array of noises that surround us.
                                As civilisation develops, new noises from
                                airports, streets, and factories are masked,
                                masking the natural sounds of nature. In his
                                book, the author claims that we are suffering
                                from an abundance of acoustic information as
                                well as a corresponding decline in our ability
                                to hear the nuances and subtleties of sound. We
                                must listen, analyse, and distinguish between
                                sounds.

                                me make the connection of how sound can be
                                memory and the soundwalk is a tool that can
                                help me achieve this. It would be interesting if
                                I could make someone recall memories of a space
                                when hearing the field recording samples. I

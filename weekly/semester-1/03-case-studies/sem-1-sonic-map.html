                                Cities and Memory project, which collects sounds
                                from around the world and remixes them to create

                                for every location: a field recording of that
                                location and a reimagined sound that presents
                                that place and time in a different light. On the
                                sound map, you have two navigation options. You
                                may choose to navigate either through the actual
                                sounds of the world or through an alternative
                                reimagined world created by sound artists.

                                Due to the recent pandemic lockdown, people were
                                able to record field recordings from different
                                parts of the world to share their experiences.
                                As a result of the social distancing rules, the
                                sounds recorded during the lockdown period are
                                silent. Every day felt like a loop of increasing
                                frustration.

                                An electronic musician, sound artist, and
                                designer from Japan, Yuri Suzuki, has created a
                                project called Sound of the Earth. As an artist,
                                his practice explores the realms of sound
                                through the design of pieces that examine how
                                music and sound interact to create personal
                                experiences by exploring the relationship
                                between people and their environments. In Sound
                                of the Earth, the artist utilises sphere-shaped
                                artefacts that represent the planet to play
                                field recordings from around the world.

                                    The vinyl globe will play folk music and
                                    national anthems recorded throughout the
                                    world as a needle passes over it. When the
                                    needle moves, the sphere plays sounds
                                    created by grooves that have been cut into
                                    the sphere, similar to traditional vinyl
                                    records. Suzuki has been working on The
                                    Sound of the Earth since 2009 and has now
                                    unveiled a prototype, although the design
                                    does not yet function perfectly—the music
                                    skips as the globe turns, as shown in the
                                    movie above.

                                    Speechless</a>. Sound of the Earth:
                                Chapter 2 is a unique interactive installation
                                that explores how sound can connect with and
                                educate people in unexpected and extraordinary
                                ways. By introducing distinct localities to
                                audiences through the medium of sound, the
                                installation challenges the way we experience
                                foreign cultures. The primary sense engaged
                                within the installation is hearing, but the
                                project has been crafted to provide a
                                multisensory experience in addition to
                                listening. As the speakers within the artefact
                                cause vibrations, those with hearing
                                difficulties may enjoy the tactile dimensions of
                                the work by touching the surface of the
                                artefact.

                                    YouTube video produced by Samuel Ruby and
                                    Jamie Koh depicts a series of field
                                    recordings taken during the circuit breaker
                                    period of the Covid pandemic.

                                    “Since circuit breaker measures kicked in on
                                    April 7, the hustle and bustle of everyday
                                    life has given way to a newfound
                                    tranquillity. The Straits Times traversed
                                    the island to capture the sights and sounds
                                    of a city under shutdown.”<br>
                                    — The Straits Times
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    There were several locations shown in the
                                    video, including Bishan MRT Station, which
                                    is usually packed with people, but was
                                    almost like a ghost station during this
                                    time. As a result of the inability to dine
                                    out during this period, food stalls are
                                    another location, so the normally noisy
                                    soundscape of a hawker centre is now
                                    extremely quiet. Because urban noises have
                                    decreased, it is easier to hear the natural
                                    soundscape during this lockdown.

                                    Ruby, and Azim Azman produced this video
                                    after the circuit breaker period. It
                                    illustrates Singapore's sights and sounds
                                    during phase one of reopening after schools
                                    and businesses were closed due to the
                                    Coronavirus outbreak. Compared to the
                                    previous video, the soundscape is vibrant as
                                    we gradually become accustomed to the
                                    pandemic, and return to our daily activities
                                    once the restrictions have been lifted.

                                    offers advanced tools for sound artists,
                                    musicians, and beginners to create
                                    soundscapes on their own. In the event that
                                    you are a beginner, you can use the
                                    Freesound database to develop your own
                                    soundwalks using the sounds that are
                                    published under a permissive licence. Music
                                    and story are also connected to locations
                                    through a GPS-enabled mobile application. As
                                    you explore a location, the application
                                    generates an appropriate soundscape from the
                                    database to match your location, ensuring
                                    that you are immersed in the environment.

                                Soundwalks can be used in many ways. While
                                researching, I discovered guided soundwalks to
                                be the most common. In guided soundwalks, the
                                user examines the environment with the
                                assistance of a voice recording of a guide who
                                will lead the user through the soundwalk
                                process.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Several ways in which the activity of the
                                soundwalk can be utilised are demonstrated in
                                this video. All the demonstrations were created
                                by the University of Illinois students enrolled
                                in MUS 243 - Introduction to Music Education
                                Technology. Listening to the examples, I found
                                that the use of sound walk as a guided tour was
                                unique and helpful since, for someone who is
                                unfamiliar with the concept of soundwalk, a
                                guided voice will assist them in understanding
                                the soundscape.

                                In the following example, the recording guides
                                users to gauge their time spent in the location
                                and to appreciate their surroundings. When asked
                                to focus on a painting found in space, the
                                recording assists in putting you in the same
                                location as the painting.

                                I found this example of a soundwalk unique
                                because it gave me a sense that I was on a quest
                                to find a missing girl, listening to a recording
                                of her voice to find clues. I believe that this
                                could be used to create an interesting gameplay
                                interaction.

                                    Ghostwalking</a> was created in 2011 by <a
                                    href="http://www.spell7performance.org/">spell#7</a>,
                                established in Singapore in 1997 by Kaylene Tan
                                (Singapore) and Paul Rae (UK). In its history,
                                culture and politics intersections in everyday
                                life through intimate theatrical performances
                                and environmental sound works, the company has
                                developed a distinct and inventive focus on
                                these intersections. The Ghostwalking programme
                                consists of audio-video walks conducted by the
                                company. The soundscapes were recorded in
                                neighbourhoods adjacent to the North East Line.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Each of the recordings serves as a guided
                                soundwalk that tells a story corresponding to
                                the location where the recordings were recorded.
                                Listeners will journey along the North-East MRT
                                line as a character named Tony. Several stops
                                will be made at different MRT stations to embark
                                on a guided soundwalk with participants.
                                Listeners will be able to download the
                                soundtracks to their smartphones, as well as
                                watch three videos depicting confessions made by
                                various Singaporeans. The concept of discovering
                                different life stories by participating in
                                guided soundwalks really appealed to me as a
                                case study.

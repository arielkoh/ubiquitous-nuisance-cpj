                                in 2017. Previously, the project was displayed

                                enhances the ability of individuals to receive
                                information, explore the world, satisfy their
                                basic needs, and experience joy and wonder.

                                Using a variety of materials and textures, the
                                designers created four white, cone-shaped
                                speakers that are similar in shape and shape. In
                                this project, the idea was to study different
                                auditory effects generated by different
                                materials and textures. The LABA speaker series
                                utilises ear-like horns which alter sound based
                                on the materials used and the shape of their
                                horns. The speakers vary in their ability to
                                amplify and reflect sound, resulting in varying
                                auditory effects.

                                beautiful horn designs and its surface profile,
                                Laba's speaker tweeters are highly polished so
                                that they reflect the beauty of the internal
                                horn details evenly, which preserves the
                                individual textures.

                                The concept of a tray of water being placed on
                                top of the speaker was an innovative idea,
                                devised by Japanese artist Akira Okamoto for the

                                the vibrations in the speaker and tray of water,
                                a visualisation of sound can be seen on the

                                    Sonic Bloom</a> is a multi-sensory sound
                                installation by Japanese artist, designer and
                                electronic musician Yuri Suzuki, which
                                encourages communication by way of sound. Using
                                a network of vibrant horn-shaped structures, the
                                installation consists of an interactive flower
                                created when these structures are combined. As a
                                result of the structure's shape, the listener
                                becomes more aware of the sounds in the space
                                and amplify the sounds from the environment.

                                Additionally, the artist created a website on
                                which the sound recordings are transformed into
                                flower animations, which are then randomly
                                'planted' onto a map of Mayfair.<br>

                                    In a post-Covid-19 reality, we are confined
                                    to our homes more than ever because of a
                                    sense of claustrophobia and an inability to
                                    see diversity in our surroundings. Yuri and
                                    the team sought to resolve this issue
                                    through the use of sound and spatial audio.
                                    In audio production, convolution reverb is a
                                    technique that creates an audio snapshot of
                                    an actual space that can then be recreated
                                    virtually.

                                participatory art, LINES is a participatory
                                project that is best explored in groups but
                                could also be experienced individually. A
                                Maxuino addon translates the sensor signals
                                through the Arduino into the Max/MSP programme.

                                There is a simplicity in the design and the
                                final installation appears minimal, but the
                                intricacies of the sound are beautifully
                                complex. The installation plays with colour and
                                sound and makes one feel as if they are inside a
                                video game.
